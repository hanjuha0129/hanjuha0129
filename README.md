- âš¡ Fun fact: My major is CSE, but I actually like Math and Physics. My height is 179.6, which is a bit disappointing, 0.4 centimeters short of 180. Also, I like running. I run 3km at 12km per hour non-stop every day. My best long jump in place record is 2m76cm. Jump better than a sport college student.
